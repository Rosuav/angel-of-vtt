<00:00:06.500>Those hazy days I do remember

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.500
We were running still
Had the whole world at our feet

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.500
Watching seasons change
Our roads were lined with adventure

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.750
Mountains in the way
Couldn't keep us from the sea

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.750
Here we stand, open arms,
This is home where we are

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.500
Ever strong in the world that we made

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.750
I still hear you in the breeze,
See your shadows in the trees,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.500
Holding on, memories never change
