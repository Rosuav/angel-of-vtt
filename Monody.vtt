00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.500
Summer in the hills
Those hazy days I do remember

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.500
We were running still
Had the whole world at our feet

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.500
Watching seasons change
Our roads were lined with adventure

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.750
Mountains in the way
Couldn't keep us from the sea

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.750
Here we stand, open arms,
This is home where we are

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.500
Ever strong in the world that we made

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.750
I still hear you in the breeze,
See your shadows in the trees,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.500
Holding on, memories never change
